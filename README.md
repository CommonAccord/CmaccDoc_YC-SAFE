# YC-SAFE
for the YCombinator "SAFE" Notes - http://www.ycombinator.com/documents/#safe (no endorsement)

This repo has prose objects for the YC SAFE Notes.  (It is not endorsed (yet?) by YC - our own work.)  

See https://github.com/CommonAccord/YC-SAFE/edit/master/README.md for more intro to  prose objects.

Happy if someone with more knowledge than ours would pickup this project and perfect it.  Flatter us with forks.

The four forms of the Notes are build by referencing the Cap Discount prose object.  See list.html for more discussion. 

Four complete Notes can be seen in a demo at http://source.commonaccord.org/index.php?action=list&file=F/Demo/Note_YC/.
